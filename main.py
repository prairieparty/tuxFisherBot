# Description: This program automatically launches Tux Fisher, before proceeding to automatically catch fish.
'''Patch Notes:
20251001: Initial commit.
- Added basic structure.
- Added imports.
- Added image & module directory search.
20251002:
- Added function to launch Tux Fisher.
- Introduced debug module with live overlay (not to be included in final build).
- Tried various image recognition methods (template matching, pyautogui, ORB).
- Added function to debug ORB keypoints.
20251008:
- Set up GitHub repository.
- Updated ORB parameters in vision module to match debug model.
- Condensed variables in main.py to their respective sections.
- Began developing detection for player avatar angle (vision module).
- Moved player images to images/player directory & updated code accordingly.
20251009:
- Started debugging player angle detection with matched keypoint geometry (debug module).
- Added black & white masking functions to debug module to assist with player angle detection.
- Changed screenshot method in vision module to use mss for better performance + ROI selection.
20251014:
- Fixed bug in screen capture using Jean's code from ImageCap.py.
- added new module loading function to condense code.
- made a working angle detection class - uses the white mask to find the penguin's general direction, and fishing rod to determine tilt angle.
20251017:
- Built a VisionCortex class to encapsulate vision functions.
- Corrected splash ROI to be dynamic based on screen size.
- Began function to rotate avatar toward splash point (control module).
- Made player rotate until facing away from camera at start of main loop.
20251021:
- Corrected splash function to actually work reliably.
- Reduced sleep times in control module to speed up rotation.
- Began correcting angle tolerances in control module for initial rotation.
- Corrected initial click to properly click the center - prior bug clicked in the top left quadrant.
20251022:
- Finished correcting initial rotation to face away from camera.
- Continued developing function to rotate avatar toward splash point.
- Redefined various control functions to use the VisionCortex class, rather than preset angle & direction variables.
- Improved error handling and logging for vision updates.
- Finally properly resolved initial click bug - used mouseDown and mouseUp instead of click().
- Adjusted thresholds for splash detection in vision module.
- Began developing cast_rod function to cast based on distance to splash point.
- The test caught its first fish!
- Added angle reporting to the debug overlay.
20251023:
- Redefined angle measurement in rotate_toward_splash function
-- So it's better, but still pretty awful.
- Cleaned up imports
- Made a pygame debugger to test out angle measurement
-- Made a .gitignore so said file doesn't take up space
'''
'''To Do:

- refine function to rotate avatar to face fish (control module)

- determine distance to fish (vision module)

- refine search function to find splashes more reliably (vision module)
